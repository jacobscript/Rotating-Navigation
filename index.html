            <p>The voices were coming from the kitchen. They were being fed through a little radio speaker in the
                ceiling. The volume was very low. Terri put the cup back down on the table, but heard nothing else.

                She hadn't felt this strange since arriving. It was really hard to stand up again after a lapse like
                that. Terri just sat there looking at her feet.

                Hoppi, the cat, had been sleeping in the kitchen. He had been doing this for the last two nights now. He
                liked having the warm sun coming through the windows while he slept. Then the sound of the voices on the
                radio kept him awake all night. Last night he had tried to play in his cat house, but it was so cold
                that he just got cold and then gave up.</p>

            <p>From the first night we spent here, a teenager with a trimmer went out each night to poison our pets. We
                left them to their fate. As a result, our beloved dogs died on our doorstep. We didn't know what to do.
                We began to speak in tongues to make ourselves understood. I needed someone to tell me what to do. We
                managed to get help from a wise local guide who took us to a clinic and saved our dog. When we called to
                thank him, he told us we should have kept the cat. But how could we leave her to the same fate? We
                managed to save a donkey from a similar fate. The donkey survived. It became our pet.</p>
